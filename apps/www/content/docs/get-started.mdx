## Starting a new project

If you are starting a new project, you can use the dashboard example right away with the following command:

```bash
npx gitpick https://github.com/ailab-core/uilab/tree/main/examples/template-vite-tanstack-router [your_project_name]
cd [your_project_name]
npm install
npm run dev
```

Every example here uses so make sure to follow the [guide](https://tanstack.com/start/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/routing).

### Examples
- [Vite Template - Tanstack Router App](https://github.com/ailab-core/uilab/tree/main/examples/template-vite-tanstack-router)
- [Vite Template - Tanstack Start App](https://github.com/ailab-core/uilab/tree/main/examples/template-vite-tanstack-start)
<Callout type="warning">
Tanstack Start Template not fully complete yet. Tanstack Start is in RC stage, not fully stable yet so expect frequent changes
</Callout>

## Manual Setup

Install these packages for your project.

```bash
npm install uilab-core tw-animate-css lucide-react
```

Import the component styles in your application entry point:

```css title='app/global.css'
@import "tailwindcss";
@import "tw-animate-css";
@import "uilab-core/styles.css";
@import "uilab-core/theme.css";

/* Make sure to add this too for themes */
@custom-variant dark (&:is(.dark *));
```

**Note that tailwindcss needs to be installed in your project! [See how](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite)**

## Registry setup

Our custom shadcn registry is deployed through GitLab pages and due to it's privacy, you will need your personal access token to add our custom components to your project

```bash title='.env.local'
PAT_TOKEN={YOUR_GITLAB_PAT_TOKEN}
```

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json",
  ...
  "registries": {
    "@uilab": {
      "url": "https://ailabmn.gitlab.io/frontend/uilab/r/{name}.json",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer ${PAT_TOKEN}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Basic Usage

Import and use components in your React application:

```tsx
import { Button, Card, CardContent, CardHeader, CardTitle } from "uilab-core"

export function Example() {
  return (
    <Card>
      <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle>Welcome to uilab-core</CardTitle>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent>
        <Button>Get Started</Button>
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  )
}
```


## TypeScript Support

All components are written in TypeScript and include complete type definitions. You'll get full IntelliSense support in your IDE:

```tsx
import { Button, type ButtonProps } from "uilab-core"

// Full type support for props
function MyButton(props: ButtonProps) {
  return <Button {...props} />
}
```

## Framework Compatibility

`uilab-core` works with anything that's on client component.

Server component however, is on experimental. There is a known issue of when using the function `cn` on server component. It errors out on console that `cn` function needs to be called in client component. A separate development will be done in near future.
