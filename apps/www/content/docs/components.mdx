import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

Most base components are direct export of [shadcn components](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components) with our custom styling except the complex ones.
It should function exactly the same except the import destination is different.

## Basic usage

```tsx
import { Button } from "uilab-core" // instead of '@/components/ui'

export function Example() {
  return <Button variant="secondary">Example</Button>
}
```

Components that are not included from shadcn in the base components are listed below.

- Carousel *(Should be optional, depending on the project)*
- Chart *(Should be optional, depending on the project)*

Don't worry, Most complex components are available in our shadcn registry with our solutions
