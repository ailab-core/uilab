uilab is a react component library. Built on top of [Base UI Primitives](https://base-ui.com/), styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and bundled with [rolldown](https://rolldownjs.org/).

This is a component library we'll be adopting for our projects at [ailab.mn](https://ailab.mn). We're building it in the open for anyone who wants to create quick, easy and reliable user interfaces.

<Callout type="info" title="Early Access">
uilab-core is currently in early development. Things may change quickly so we recomment using this in projects where you're comfortable adapting to changes.

## How it works

The reason for making it a separate library instead of using shadcn directly is to have our own internal company design system and an ability to change and control certain components without interacting with the project. We currently have and soon will be having many projects under our company and to change a component style and functionality is a massive work.

We separated it into 2 parts.

- **Components** - Base atom components such as Button, Alert, Input, Card etc will be separate installable package.
- **Blocks** - More complex molecule components. This needs more customization based on the project requirements so we decided to go with shadcn/ui registry distribution.
