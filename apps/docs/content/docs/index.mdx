## Introduction

`uilab-core` is a React component library. Most of the components are built using [shadcn components](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components) and bundled with [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/).

The reason for making it a separate library instead of using shadcn directly is to have our own internal company design system and an ability to change and control certain components without interacting with the project. We currently have and soon will be having many projects under our company and to change a component style is a massive work.

But, we separated it into 2 parts.

Smaller *atom* components are made into a library, and more complex components *molecule* (datatable, data-list, form-sheet etc) are made into shadcn registry. So you can download or copy the code for the project needs.
