title: Components
---

Most base components are direct export of [shadcn components](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components) except the complex ones.
It should function exactly the same except the import destination is different.

## Basic usage

```tsx
import { Button } from "uilab-core" // instead of '@/components/ui'

export function Example() {
  return <Button variant="secondary">Example</Button>
}
```

Components that are not included from shadcn in the base components are listed below.

- Carousel *(Should be optional, depending on the project)*
- Chart *(Should be optional, depending on the project)*
- [Data Table](/docs/blocks/data-table)
- [Date Picker](/docs/blocks/date-picker)
- [Sonner](/docs/blocks/sonner)

Don't worry, Most useful components are available in our [shadcn registry](/docs/blocks)
