Most base components are direct export of [shadcn components](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components) except the complex ones.
It should function exactly the same except the import destination is different.

## Basic usage

```tsx
import { Button } from "uilab-core" // instead of '@/components/ui'

export function Example() {
  return <Button variant="secondary">Example</Button>
}
```

Components that are not included in the base components are listed below.

- Carousel
- Chart
- Data Table
- Date Picker
- Sonner

Don't worry, These components are available in our [shadcn registry](/docs/ui/blocks)
