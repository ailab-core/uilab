## Starting a new project

If you are starting a new project, you can use the dashboard example right away with the following command:

```
npx gitpick https://gitlab.com/ailabmn/frontend/uilab/examples/lab-dashboard
cd lab-dashboard
npm install
npm run dev
```

Every example here uses so make sure to follow the [guide](https://tanstack.com/start/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/routing).

### Examples
- [Basic Dashboard](https://gitlab.com/ailabmn/frontend/uilab/examples/basic-dashboard)

## Manual Setup

Install these packages for your project.

```bash
npm install uilab-core tw-animate-css lucide-react
```

Import the component styles in your application entry point:

```css title='app/global.css'
@import "uilab-core/styles.css";
@import "uilab-core/theme.css";

/* Make sure to add this too for themes */
@custom-variant dark (&:is(.dark *));
```

**Note that tailwindcss needs to be installed in your project! [See how](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite)**

### Basic Usage

Import and use components in your React application:

```tsx
import { Button, Card, CardContent, CardHeader, CardTitle } from "uilab-core"

export function Example() {
  return (
    <Card>
      <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle>Welcome to uilab-core</CardTitle>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent>
        <Button>Get Started</Button>
      </CardContent>
    </Card>
  )
}
```


## TypeScript Support

All components are written in TypeScript and include complete type definitions. You'll get full IntelliSense support in your IDE:

```tsx
import { Button, type ButtonProps } from "uilab-core"

// Full type support for props
const MyButton: React.FC<ButtonProps> = (props) => {
  return <Button {...props} />
}
```

## Framework Compatibility

uilab-core works with anything that's on client component.

Server component however, is on experimental. There is a known issue of when using the function `cn` on server component. It errors out on console that `cn` function needs to be called in client component. A separate development will be done in near future.
